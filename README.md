# Zero Sum Setlist Editor

![Logo](logo.png)

Zero Sum Setlist Editor is an app that allows you to generate setlists for all your live shows. The app not only allows you arrange songs and add encores and intermissions, but allows you to add notes for each song, for each role. For example, if a guitarist had to use a special tuning, that could be noted on the setlist to help remember. After editing, you can create a PDF file for all your printing needs.

The editor is currently quite basic, but I plan to continue to add to it. Here is a list of planned features:
- ~~Customization for the setlist~~
- ~~Statistics~~
- Automatic setlist generation from template
  - Using "bustouts", inspired by [kglw.net](https://kglw.net)
  - Looking at previous setlist, make choices from a list
  - Taking length of show into account

***This app works, but it is a little glitchy as I am working on this on my own. If you find a bug, please report it as an issue so I am aware. Any contributions would be welcome.***
