# Zero Sum Setlist Editor

![Logo](logo.png)

Zero Sum is an app that allows you to generate setlists for all your live shows. The app not only allows you arrange songs and add encores and intermissions, but allows you to add notes for each song, for each role. For example, if a guitarist had to use a special tuning, that could be noted on the setlist to help remember. After editing, you can create a PDF file for all your printing needs.

**The editor is currently quite basic, but I plan to continue to add to it. It also has it's fair share of issues as I am still new to software development and I'm doing this on my own.**

Any contributions would be welcome.
